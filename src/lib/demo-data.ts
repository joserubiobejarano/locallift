export const demoAuditMarkdown = `## Quick score

Your Google Business Profile scores **72/100** based on our analysis.

## Priority fixes

1. **Missing business hours** - Your profile shows "Hours may vary" which can reduce trust. Add specific opening hours for each day.

2. **Incomplete description** - Your business description is too short (only 45 characters). Google recommends at least 750 characters to help with local SEO.

3. **Low photo count** - You have 8 photos, but competitors in your area average 25+. Add more photos of your food, interior, and staff.

4. **No posts in 30 days** - Regular posts help you stay visible in search results. Post at least once per week.

## Suggested profile name

**Current:** BurgerMat - Madrid

**Suggestion:** Keep as is. Your name is clear and includes the location.

## Suggested description

Here's an improved description for your profile:

"BurgerMat is a family-friendly burger restaurant in the heart of Madrid, serving fresh, high-quality burgers made with locally sourced ingredients. We offer a wide variety of options including classic beef burgers, vegetarian alternatives, and gluten-free buns. Our friendly staff is committed to providing excellent service in a welcoming atmosphere. Perfect for lunch, dinner, or a quick bite. We also offer takeout and delivery services.

## Post ideas for the next 30 days

1. **Week 1:** "New menu item alert! Try our limited-time BBQ Bacon Burger, available this week only."

2. **Week 2:** "Behind the scenes: Meet our head chef and learn about our commitment to using fresh, local ingredients."

3. **Week 3:** "Customer spotlight: Share a photo of a happy customer enjoying their meal (with permission)."

4. **Week 4:** "Special offer: Mention this post and get 10% off your next order. Valid until the end of the month."

## Image recommendations

1. **Food photos** - Add 5-10 high-quality photos of your most popular menu items. Use natural lighting and make sure the food looks appetizing.

2. **Interior shots** - Show your dining area, highlighting the atmosphere and cleanliness.

3. **Team photos** - Include photos of your friendly staff to build trust and show the human side of your business.

4. **Exterior photo** - Make sure you have a clear, well-lit photo of your storefront so customers can easily find you.

5. **Action shots** - Photos of food being prepared or served can create a sense of freshness and quality.`;
